In 0nprofit spots - the budgets were so tight everyone complained all the time and had it hard...0t as hard as me with untreated ADHD, depression and anxiety...but hard. It should have come up in all previous workplaces but I never feel safe bringing it up. I freelance 0w so I can deal with structuring my own work hours etc...but, I am really really struggling both due to isolation and just...freelancing is a real grind. If I didn't have Obamacare I would be completely screwed. AS it is I am only semi screwed. ALSO  - what I wish you would ask in this survey is about caretaking. 
I am female in IT..and disabled. I take care of my elderly mother and my developmentally disabled brother. 
What NEVER gets discussed is who does the caretaking in families when someone breaks down or is unable to work...it's women, sisters, daughters, mothers... So PLEASE work caretaking survey questions into your surveys.

I can't just say it's about me...I'm under water because 0 one is helping with my brother or mother..least of all my father who died penniless after years on wall street making millions. He was ADHD too...and alcoholic and depressed...but, he was a ""master of the universe"" type doing IPOs for tech companies...and a ""liberatarian""... 

So yeah - please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape. I'm screwed 0T just because of my disabilities...but my gender as well.

Sooo - this survey should have a ""Did we miss anything"" open question at the end. Two things. One - My ADHD is an asset when treated and understood...Also - When I finally got coverage at work 20 years ago...I was put on a med which I had a very bad reaction to - at work. Getting treated (after decades) ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so. Wrong meds *really* messed me up - along with wrong DX. I couldn't be open about it. And then had a serious breakdown at work...and was fired immediately. 0 mercy. 0 understanding - I told them what was going on and I was gone. Because I wasn't well.. I couldn't defend myself. I became homeless for a while. I'm OK 0w...but it was a *mess* caused BY getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depression...I was in Silicon Valley at the time and over 30 and female. There was 0 space for me to be anything less that 120% perfect as I was one of very few women working in SV at the time.",0, I don't want to poison the well... people are prejudiced and in denial about their own issues and vulnerabilities I find...I wish I felt differently...,1,1,2,"1, I experienced",Maybe,1,1,1,"Anxiety Disorder (Generalized, Social, Phobia, etc)|Mood Disorder (Depression, Bipolar Disorder, etc)|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",,1,"Anxiety Disorder (Generalized, Social, Phobia, etc)|Mood Disorder (Depression, Bipolar Disorder, etc)|Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",1,1,4,53,Female,United States of America,Oregon,United States of America,Oregon,Other|Front-end Developer|Designer|One-person shop,Always
